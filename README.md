# Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion in C

This program demonstrates the insertion operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C. It allows you to insert nodes into the BST and perform an inorder traversal to print the values in sorted order.

## Description

This C program performs the following operations:

1. **Create a Binary Search Tree (BST):** A tree structure where for each node, the left child contains values less than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.
2. **Insert Nodes:** Insert new nodes into the BST according to the BST property.
3. **Inorder Traversal:** Perform an inorder traversal of the BST to print the values in ascending order.

### BST Structure:
The BST is represented using a `struct node`, where:
- `key` is the value stored at the node.
- `left` is a pointer to the left child node.
- `right` is a pointer to the right child node.

The program builds the BST by inserting several nodes, and the inorder traversal is used to print the nodes in sorted order.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- You need a C compiler such as `gcc` to compile and run the code.

### Steps:
1. Copy the C program into a file, say `bst.c`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `bst.c`.
4. Compile the C program:
   ```bash
   gcc bst.c -o bst
   ```
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./bst
   ```

## Code Explanation

### Functions:

- **`newNode(int item)`**: 
    - Creates a new node with the given key (`item`).
    - Initializes the left and right pointers to `NULL`.

- **`inorder(struct node* root)`**: 
    - Performs an inorder traversal of the BST. It prints the keys of the nodes in ascending order.
    - Recursively traverses the left subtree, then prints the node's key, and finally traverses the right subtree.

- **`insert(struct node* node, int key)`**: 
    - Inserts a new node with the given key (`key`) into the BST.
    - If the tree is empty, it creates a new node.
    - Otherwise, it recursively inserts the key in the left or right subtree based on the value.

- **`main()`**:
    - Initializes an empty BST.
    - Inserts several nodes to build the tree.
    - Prints the inorder traversal of the tree.

### Tree Construction Example:

The tree is built by inserting the following values:
```plaintext
50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80
```

The resulting tree structure will be:

```
              50
           /     \
          30      70
         /  \    /  \
       20   40  60   80
```

## Example Output

When you run the program, the inorder traversal of the tree will produce the following output:

```
Inorder Traversal of BST:
20 
30 
40 
50 
60 
70 
80 
```

This is the list of values in sorted order as expected from an inorder traversal of the Binary Search Tree.

### How to Edit:

1. **Edit the Program Description**: You can change the description to suit the exact features of your program. For example, you may wish to add details on any extra functionality or customization in the `insert()` or `inorder()` functions.
2. **Customize Example Output**: If your tree changes or you plan to give a different example, update the example output accordingly.
3. **License Section**: Feel free to modify or replace the license section if you are using a different license for the project.
